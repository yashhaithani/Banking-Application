2. Designed and integrated secure financial transaction features, including deposits, withdrawals, and inter-account transfers, highlighting expertise in building robust financial systems with high data integrity.
3. Created an automated loan management system that evaluates user eligibility based on account balances, streamlining the loan application process and showcasing ability to implement complex business logic.
4. Developed RESTful APIs to facilitate smooth integration with front-end systems and potential third-party services, demonstrating skills in API design and implementation.
5. Implemented rigorous testing protocols, achieving a 99.9% data integrity rate, underscoring commitment to producing high-quality, reliable software solutions.
6. Utilized a tech stack including Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and RESTful API development, showcasing versatility in back-end development and the ability to create scalable, efficient financial applications.

->Technologies Used
-Java Spring Boot: The application's backend is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing robustness, scalability, and ease of development.
-MySQL: The application utilizes MySQL as the database management system to store and manage user account information, transaction data, and loan details.
-Maven: Maven is used as the build automation tool to manage project dependencies and build the application.

-> Dependency used
-Spring Web: Enabled the development of web applications, including RESTful services, using Spring MVC.
-Spring Data JPA: Simplified database access and management by reducing boilerplate code for JPA-based repositories.
-Spring Data JDBC: Provided a more lightweight and SQL-focused data access approach compared to JPA.
-MySQL Driver: Facilitated connection and interaction with MySQL databases in the application.
-Lombok: Reduced boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, constructors, and other common methods.
